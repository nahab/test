Verse 1
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
Cos this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one die

Chorus
Im looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

Im looking for complications
Looking cos Im tired of lying (trying in 2nd chorus)
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)

Verse 2
Think Im done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
Id give it all away
If you give me one last try

We live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything is all right

Chorus

Bridge
Fly along with me
I cant quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
(x2)

Chorus
